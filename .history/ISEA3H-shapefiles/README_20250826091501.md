This repository contains shapefiles for the ISEA3H grid at resolutions 1-9. The shapefiles were generated using R and the `sf` package. 

These shapefiles are intended to be used with GBIF SQL downloads. It is not possible to use the `dggridR` package directly with GBIF SQL downloads because GBIF uses **geogrid_id** 

Here is an example of how to use the shapefiles with GBIF SQL downloads and rgbif: 

```R
library(rgbif)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

sql <-
"
SELECT 
  GBIF_ISEA3HCode(
    6, 
    decimalLatitude,
    decimalLongitude,
    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 1000) 
  ) AS geogrid_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT speciesKey) AS unique_species_count
FROM
  occurrence
  WHERE hasCoordinate = TRUE
  AND (coordinateUncertaintyInMeters <= 1000 OR coordinateUncertaintyInMeters IS NULL)
  AND speciesKey IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'ZERO_COORDINATE')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COORDINATE_OUT_OF_RANGE')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COORDINATE_INVALID')
  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(issue, 'COUNTRY_COORDINATE_MISMATCH')
GROUP BY
  geogrid_id
"

d <- occ_download_get('0045164-250811113504898') %>% 
    occ_download_import() |>
    mutate(geogrid_id = as.character(geogrid_id)) 

sf_obj <- st_read("ISEA3H-shapefiles/resolution-6/ISEA3H-6.shp")
sf_obj |> glimpse()

dd <- merge(sf_obj, d, by = "geogrid_id") |> glimpse()

p <- ggplot() +
geom_sf(data=dd, aes(fill = unique_species_count)) +
scale_fill_viridis_c() +
theme_minimal()

ggsave(p, filename = "ISEA3H-shapefiles/grid_plot.svg", width = 12, height = 8)

# Generating the Shapefiles



I used the `ISEA3H.R` script to generate the shapefiles. The script uses the `geogrid-dem-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file from the `geogrid` project to create the mapping from geodgrid_id 

dggridR

I would advise generating higher resolution grids with `ISEA3H.R` and the `geogrid-dem-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file unless absolutely necessary.
